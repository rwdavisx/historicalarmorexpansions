 GER_panzer_i_equipment_a_short:0 "Panzer I A"
 GER_panzer_i_equipment_a_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s, originally known as MG Panzerwagen (V Kfz 617). It's performance in combat was limited by its thin armour and light armament of two machine guns. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was not as capable as other light tanks of the era."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_b_short:0 "Panzer I B"
 GER_panzer_i_equipment_b_desc:0 "After initial service the Ausf A was found to be underpowered and the engine prone to overheating. A more powerful engine was fitted and the superstructure transferred to the longer chassis of the kl Pz Bef Wg to produce the Ausf B, a.k.a. LaS Maybach, seeing service from 1935-1943, latterly as a command tank."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_c_desc:0 "The Ausf C light tracked reconnaissance vehicle, a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA or VK601, was a comprehensive re-design of the Pz I, with little commonality with earlier Ausfuhrungen introducing the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) used in many later Panzers."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_f_desc:0 "The Ausf F heavily armoured infantry assault tank (MG armed), a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA verstärkt or VK1801, was an up-armoured Pz I with the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) of the Ausf C, and a turret mounting two machine-guns."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_bison_short:0 "Sturmpanzer I Bison"
 GER_panzer_i_equipment_bison_desc:0 "The Invasion of Poland had shown that the towed sIG 33 guns assigned to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with the tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. A sIG 33 was mounted on the chassis of the Panzer I Ausf. B, complete with carriage and wheels, in place of the turret and superstructure."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_flak_short:0 "Flakpanzer I"
 GER_panzer_i_equipment_flak_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer I was developed during the Battle of France when it was recognized that the motorised Flak was insufficiently armoured. The German Heereswaffenamt decided to combine light anti-aircraft guns with tank chassis. The chassis of the Panzer I was used for these conversions, simply because it was available."

 GER_panzer_i_equipment_jager_short:0 "Panzerjäger I"
 GER_panzer_i_equipment_jager_desc:0 "The Panzerjäger I was the very first tank hunter in German service. The early converted models operated during the campaign of France, in May-June 1940, making up for the lack of high-velocity guns against the well-protected French tanks."
