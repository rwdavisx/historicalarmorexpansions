 ### Neubaufahrzeug ###
 GER_armor_neubaufahrzeug_equipment_stock:0 "PanzerKampfwagen NeubauFahrzeug V"
 GER_armor_neubaufahrzeug_equipment_stock_short:0 "NeubauFahrzeug"
 GER_armor_neubaufahrzeug_equipment_stock_desc:0 "The German Neubaufahrzeug series of tank prototypes were a first attempt to create a heavy tank for the Wehrmacht after Adolf Hitler had come to power. Multi-turreted, heavy and slow, they were not considered successful. It was intended that these designs would fulfill the role of heavy tank in the armored forces, but the design proved to be too complex and unreliable for this role."

 ### Panzer I ###
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_a:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. A"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_a_short:0 "Panzer I A"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_a_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s, originally known as MG Panzerwagen (V Kfz 617). It's performance in combat was limited by its thin armour and light armament of two machine guns. As a design intended for training, the Panzer I was not as capable as other light tanks of the era."

 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_b:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. B"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_b_short:0 "Panzer I B"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_b_desc:0 "After initial service the Ausf A was found to be underpowered and the engine prone to overheating. A more powerful engine was fitted and the superstructure transferred to the longer chassis of the kl Pz Bef Wg to produce the Ausf B, a.k.a. LaS Maybach, seeing service from 1935-1943, latterly as a command tank."

 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_c:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. C"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_c_short:0 "Panzer I C"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_c_desc:0 "The Ausf C light tracked reconnaissance vehicle, a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA or VK601, was a comprehensive re-design of the Pz I, with little commonality with earlier Ausfuhrungen introducing the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) used in many later Panzers."

 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_f:0 "Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf. F"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_f_short:0 "Panzer I F"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_f_desc:0 "The Ausf F heavily armoured infantry assault tank (MG armed), a.k.a. PzKpfW I nA verstärkt or VK1801, was an up-armoured Pz I with the Schachtellaufwerk (inter-leaved track wheels) of the Ausf C, and a turret mounting two machine-guns."

 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_bison:0 "sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_bison_short:0 "Sturmpanzer I Bison"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_bison_desc:0 "The Invasion of Poland had shown that the towed sIG 33 guns assigned to the infantry gun companies of the motorized infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with the tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. A sIG 33 was mounted on the chassis of the Panzer I Ausf. B, complete with carriage and wheels, in place of the turret and superstructure."
  
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_flak:0 "Flak 38 auf Panzer I Ausführung A"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_flak_short:0 "Flakpanzer I"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_flak_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer I was developed during the Battle of France when it was recognized that the motorised Flak was insufficiently armoured. The German Heereswaffenamt decided to combine light anti-aircraft guns with tank chassis. The chassis of the Panzer I was used for these conversions, simply because it was available."

 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_jager:0 "PaK(t) (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I ohne Turm"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_jager_short:0 "Panzerjäger I"
 GER_armor_panzer_i_equipment_jager_desc:0 "The Panzerjäger I was the very first tank hunter in German service. The early converted models operated during the campaign of France, in May-June 1940, making up for the lack of high-velocity guns against the well-protected French tanks."

### Panzer II ###
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_aa:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. a/3 (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_aa_short:0 "Panzer II a"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_aa_desc:0 "The Panzer II's armour could protect its crew from small arms fire and 7.92 mm S.M.K steel-cored armour-piercing machine gun bullets fired from a range of 30 m. It was designed to engage enemy machine gun nests and destroy them to enable the infantry to continue to advance, not to engage in tank on tank combat."

 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_bb:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. b (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_bb_short:0 "Panzer II b"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_bb_desc:0 "Early versions of the Panzer II changed shape over time as they were upgraded during their operational life. Additional armour was added and features like cupolas were fitted."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_cc:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. c (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_cc_short:0 "Panzer II c"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_cc_desc:0 "This version of the Panzer II removed the bullet ricochet ‘splash’ plate and the dummy cone shaped periscope in front of the commander’s hatch. The additional armour added to the front hull glacis plates changed the look from a curved frontal armoured hull to an angular shape."

 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_a:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. A (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_a_short:0 "Panzer II A"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_a_desc:0 "The Panzer II Ausf.A was the final standardised version ready for mass production. Only minor internal changes were made. A new gear box was fitted. The fuel pump, oil filter and cooler were relocated on the engine. The tank’s electrical system was supressed to try and stop it interfering with the AM radio reception and transmission."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_b:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. B (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_b_short:0 "Panzer II B"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_b_desc:0 "Panzer II tanks were built with a few minor alterations like vertical bullet deflectors welded to the sides of the superstructure in front of the vision ports. 50 mm thick bullet proof glass were bolted behind the vison slit. During the production run strengthening reinforcing rods were added to the hull and angle irons were welded inside the engine compartment."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_c:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. C (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_c_short:0 "Panzer II C"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_c_desc:0 "The Ausf.C was ordered to keep the factories busy until the Panzer III tank was ready for mass production. The only visible difference is a new type of improved vision port. It had two conical beaded bolts of the face plate and two large bolts above and below it to keep the 50 mm bullet proof glass in place."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_d:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. D (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_d_short:0 "Panzer II D"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_d_desc:0 "A new Maybach HL 62 TRM engine and a new Maybach Variorex VG 102128 7-speed gearbox enabled this heavier Panzer II Ausf.D tank to reach top speeds of 55 km/h. One of the major differences was that the radio operator now has his own armoured forward vision port and hatch at the front of the tank. The front hull armour was now 30 mm thick and of an angular rather than a curved design."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_flamm:0 "Flamm-Panzer II"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_flamm_short:0 "Flamingo"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_flamm_desc:0 "The Flamm used a new turret mounting a single MG34 machine gun, and two remotely controlled flamethrowers mounted in small turrets at each front corner of the vehicle. Each flamethrower could cover the front 180° arc, while the turret traversed 360°."

 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_f:0 "Panzerkampfwagen II Ausf. F (Sd.Kfz.131)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_f_short:0 "Panzer II F"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_f_desc:0 "The Panzer II Ausf.F was built with the thicker 30 mm armour on the front of the tank hull and 30 mm armour of the front of the turret. A fake armoured visor, made from aluminium alloy, was bolted onto the front of the hull to the right of the driver’s vision port. This was done to distract enemy fire away from the driver."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_marder_ii:0 "PaK 40 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II (Sd.Kfz.121)"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_marder_ii_short:0 "Marder II"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_marder_ii_desc:0 "The Marder II mounted the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew. Nevertheless, the Marder II provided a great increase in firepower over contemporary German tanks during 1942 and into 1943."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_wespe:0 "Leichte Feldhaubitze 18/2 auf Fahrgestell Panzerkampfwagen II"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_wespe_short:0 "Wespe"
 GER_armor_panzer_ii_equipment_wespe_desc:0 "The Wespe was a frontline self-propelled howitzer motor carriage that served with various Panzerartillerie Abteilungen on the Eastern front and North Africa, alongside heavier SPGs like the Hummel and Bison."

 GER_armor_panzer_iii_equipment_d_short:0 "Panzer III D"
 GER_armor_panzer_iii_equipment_d_desc:0 "The Panzer III Ausf.D was the last and biggest pre-production series. The early Panzer III series were the testbeds for the mass-production Panzer III Ausf.E."
 
 GER_armor_panzer_iii_equipment_e:0 "Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf. E"
 GER_armor_panzer_iii_equipment_e_short:0 "Panzer III E"
 GER_armor_panzer_iii_equipment_e_desc:0 "The Ausf.E. was the first actual production series of the Panzer III, redesigned for mass production, built by Daimler-Benz, Henschel and MAN from October 1939. It had a shortened hull, brand new independent torsion bar suspension (by Porsche), six roadwheels and three return rollers, increased armor up to 30 mm (1.18 in), side hull escape hatches, new turret two-piece hatches, added vision port and better visor."
