 GER_panzer_ii_equipment_aa_desc:0 "The Panzer II's armour could protect its crew from small arms fire and 7.92 mm S.M.K steel-cored armour-piercing machine gun bullets fired from a range of 30 m. It was designed to engage enemy machine gun nests and destroy them to enable the infantry to continue to advance, not to engage in tank on tank combat."

 GER_panzer_ii_equipment_c_short:0 "Panzer II C"
 GER_panzer_ii_equipment_c_desc:0 "The Ausf.C was ordered to keep the factories busy until the Panzer III tank was ready for mass production. The only visible difference is a new type of improved vision port. It had two conical beaded bolts of the face plate and two large bolts above and below it to keep the 50 mm bullet proof glass in place."

One of the major differences was that the radio operator now has his own armoured forward vision port and hatch at the front of the tank. The front hull armour was now 30 mm thick and of an angular rather than a curved design."
